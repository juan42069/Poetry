I
Tried 
so 
hard 
got 
so far
In the end it doesnt even matter.


I 
had 
to fall
to lose 
it all
But in the end it doesnt even matter.

One thing,
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter
how hard you try
Keep that in mind,
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself 
how I tried so hard

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
